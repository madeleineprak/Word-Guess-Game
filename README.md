# Word-Guess-Game
This is my celebrity word guessing game. Click [here](https://madeleineprak.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/) to play it.

Tools utilized:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (See documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).)
* JavaScript
* jQuery 

# How To Play
Use your keyboard to try to guess the letters of the celebrity's name. If you get a letter right it will fill in the blanks and if you get it wrong it will be added to the wrong letter list. You can play as many times as you want and the game will keep track of your wins.
