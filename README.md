The app displays a set of unrelated pictures that serve as hints to a particular celebrity's name. Either a correct and incorrect letter is registered when the user inputs a letter on their keyboard and displays respectively in the html. You start out with a certain number of guesses and if you use them up you lose. Because of needing a keyboard for event inputs, the app is limited to desktop users for now.

Tools utilized:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (See documentation [here](https://getbootstrap.com/).)
* JavaScript
* jQuery 

# How To Play
Use your keyboard to try to guess the letters of the celebrity's name. If you get a letter right it will fill in the blanks and if you get it wrong it will be added to the wrong letter list. You can play as many times as you want and the game will keep track of your wins.
